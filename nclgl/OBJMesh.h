Description: Implementation of the Wavefront OBJ mesh format. 

This was going to be a full tutorial, and then I implemented it and was
reminded of how horrific OBJ files can be, so just dumped the code in the 
framework, instead. 

You'll very quickly find OBJ meshes that can't be loaded by this loader.

First up - any mesh with anything other than triangles in it won't work. Quads
should be trivial to add in, n-sided polygons should be OK if they are convex
(add a point in the middle and create triangles out of pairs of points).

Some OBJ meshes use negative indices, which won't work.

In both cases, loading the OBJ into Blender or maybe Milkshape, and exporting
them out as OBJs again might create a file more likely to load. 

OBJ files are ok for simple geometry (the tutorial series uses them for 2
slightly different cubes, and an icosphere), but generally don't work very
well for 'big' geometry. 

The simple loader doesn't do anything fancy with indices - have fun trying
to get that working!
